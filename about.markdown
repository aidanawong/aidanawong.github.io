I am an undergraduate Honors Physics student currently studying at the University of Alberta. I was interested in laws of motion from a young age, and I enjoy tackling problems of any kind, from challenging math problems, to crossword puzzles, to deciphering elusive novels. 

Recently I have been researching Turing pattern formation under some great professors and tutoring fellow students. Outside of studying for my classes I am learning web development and history. I hope to never stop inquiring about our world and whatever lies beyond.
